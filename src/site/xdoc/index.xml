    <section name="About">
      <p>
        The unix-maven-plugin is a Maven plugin for producing installation packages for UNIX platforms.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Highlights">
        <p>
          The plugin currently support the following packaging formats and platforms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>DPKG</code> - Debian and Debian-based platforms like Ubuntu
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>PKG</code> - Platforms with System V packaging tools like Solaris and HP-UX. Only Solaris is tested.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>RPM</code> - RedHat, Fedora and other platforms using RPM. Many platforms have RPM even if they use
            another format as their primary format.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other features
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simplified assembly: the plugin supports assembling the package with correct file ownership and modes.
          </li>
          <li>Repository index generation: Goals for running dpkg-scanpackages and catalog generation for pkg-get (not
            implemented)
          </li>
          <li>Optional compression of packages. Only applicable for the PKG format as DPKG and RPM automatically
            compress the data files.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
    </section>
    <section name="Requirements">
      <p>
        When building packages for a specific format these the packaging tools need to be available on PATH.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>DPKG</code> - dpkg-deb
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>PKG</code> - pkgmk and pkgtrans
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>RPM</code> - rpmbuild
        </li>
      </ul>
