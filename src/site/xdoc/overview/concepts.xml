        <p>
          The plugin can operate in two major modes, depending on how it is configured:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Primary artifact mode</b>: The plugin is running in primary mode when the project has set a
            <code>&lt;packaging&gt;</code> to one of the packaging that the plugin support. The plugin will
            install an artifact as the primary artifact into the repository
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Attached artifact mode</b>: The plugin is running in attached mode when the project is executing the
            one of the <code>package-FOO-attached</code> goals. The plugin will install a package in addition to
            the primary artifact which will be delivered by another plugin.
          </li>
        </ul>
